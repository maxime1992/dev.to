This is an example of how to structure a blog post.

The thing above delimited by `---` is called a "front matter" and it allows us to keep control over our article in a very easy way. Just edit it with your own data and CI will handle the rest to publish it to dev.to!

You can also take advantage of [embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme) to extract your code from the markdown file and make sure that what you're displaying in the markdown is always up to date too e.g.

```ts
// code/demo-code.ts

interface A {
  hello: string;
}
```
